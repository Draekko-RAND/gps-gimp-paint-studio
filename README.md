What is GPS?
===

GPS is a collection of brushes and accompanying tool presets. Tool presets are a simply saved tool options, highly useful feature of the GIMP.  

The goal of GPS is to provide an adequate working environment for graphic designers and artists to begin to paint and feel comfortable with GIMP from their first use. Later the user will change these settings based on his own workflow preferences and understanding of GIMP.  

GPS is only a starting point for presets and brushes and is intended to highlight the expansive flexibility of GIMP. It is also intended as a way to learn from and share with each other within the GIMP community. That is why GPS comes with the Creative Commons license.
